I am a Brisbane Developer, currently working in SAP technology, who is interested in becoming a data or spatial analyst. This site will serve as a portfolio, shwoing my work with QGIS and python. I also hope to create something useful which hasn't been effectively explained elsewhere, so I'm aiming to have interesting maps and clear steps in all my posts.
