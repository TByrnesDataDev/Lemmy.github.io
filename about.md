I am a Brisbane Developer, currently working in SAP technology, who is interested in becoming a data or GIS analyst. This site will serve as a portfolio, showing my work with QGIS, python and mobile app development.

I aim to create QIS projects to help others start off in GIS, identifying common pitfalls and best practices. I will also work through the beginning of a GIS project, starting with a custom data collection app (built in Leaflet.js) through to analysis and the display of collected data.
