First post on the newly generated jekyll page! Will need to investigate how markdown wors, and how to post code, gifs and images so I can kick this into gear.

`
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
`
I intend to use this github page as a portfolio of work, initially to delve int QIS analysis (using QGIS mostly) but also python development. 

As an example I figured out that QGIS lets you export your aps into html form, like below. 
[model](https://rawgit.com/TierynnB/TierynnB.github.io/master/mapModels/3dModelOutput.html)

Or to display a map as a model (.stl, an object type used in animation/any sort of modelling software such as Blender, AutoCad I assume).

In a later post I will explain the steps to do both of these.
