title: Building Brisbane Elevations' from a Point Cloud
---

IT is extremely handy to have accurate heights for buildings when building 3 dimensional models of urban and suburban areas. It is unfortunate that not all areas have them readily available, or they may be behind a paywall. This post describes how you can use LIDAR values, or a point cloud, to approximate building heights.

This post just focusses on the buildings, but a future post will try to make the model a bit better with respect to roads and the satellite imagery of the area.
